**Exercise 1a: Compiling**

This initial exercise gives you some practice of compiling and running code from the command line.

• Open a text editor (e.g. notepad++, VS Code, nano) and write a short Java programme with a main method that prints Hello World. e.g.
 
```java
 public class HelloWorld {
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      
      System.out.println("Hello, World!");
       
        }
        
  }
  ```
• Save this is as a file called HelloWorld.java.

• Open a command prompt.

• Navigate to the folder comtaining the file you just created.

• Compile the code using: javac HelloWorld.java (if successful, this will create a HelloWorld.class file).

• Run the code using: java HelloWorld. Note: java not javac, and no extension after the filename.
