**Exercise 1c: Static**

Create a static variable within the Employee class to hold the value of the number of employees created.
Each time an Employee instance is created, ID is set according to the value of this variable which is then incremented.
Next, create a static method getIDcount() that returns the number of unique IDs that have been assigned to employees.
