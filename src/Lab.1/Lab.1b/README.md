**Exercise 1b: Designing classes**

Write a new Java file with a class to represent an employee. This class is to be used for staff managament purposes
(e.g. payroll). 

The class needs to:
• Be called Employee
• Have 4 instance variables: name, ID, salary, department
• Have a constructor that takes 3 parameters to match the instance variables except ID
• Have a method (called editName) to modify the employee’s name

Make sure that you use approriate variable types and visibility modifiers.
